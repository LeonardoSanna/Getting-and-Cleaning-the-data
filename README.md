##Script
In this repo we have only one script that is made for:

1. Downloading the dataset, unzipping it and create a single dataset from multiple files

2. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3. Renaming some variables

4. Finally, it outputs an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
